# Buddy — Your Coding Companion

Handle the user's `/buddy` command using the claude-buddy MCP tools.

## Fallback: MCP Tools Unavailable

**Before routing any command, check whether `mcp__claude_buddy__*` tools are registered in this session.** If they are NOT — Claude Code was unable to start the claude-buddy MCP server — do not attempt to call any buddy tool. The tool calls will fail with an unhelpful "tool not found" error. Instead, run this diagnostic and report the result to the user so they can fix the underlying cause:

1. Check bun availability:
   ```bash
   command -v bun && bun --version
   ```
   The MCP launcher (`server/mcp-launcher.sh`) requires `bun` on PATH. If this command prints nothing, bun is missing — tell the user to install it (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`), open a new terminal so PATH picks it up, and restart Claude Code. That is almost always the fix.

2. If bun IS present, run the launcher directly to capture whatever error it emits. The launcher path depends on which marketplace installed the plugin; locate it first:
   ```bash
   find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -name mcp-launcher.sh -path '*claude-buddy*' 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Then execute the first result with stdin closed so it exits cleanly:
   ```bash
   <launcher-path> < /dev/null; echo "exit=$?"
   ```
   Report the stdout/stderr and exit code verbatim. Common causes: missing `bun`, corrupted plugin cache (suggest `claude plugin uninstall claude-buddy@claude-buddy && claude plugin install claude-buddy@claude-buddy`), or a `bun`-level error loading `server/index.ts`.

3. If `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set in the environment, use that directory instead of `~/.claude` when searching for the launcher.

4. **Do not proceed with any buddy command in this session.** Tell the user: the MCP server is not running, here is what the diagnostic found, here is the recommended fix, and Claude Code must be restarted after the fix before buddy tools will be available.

## Routing: run the LLM-free dispatcher

**Every typed `/buddy` command is a pure config/state operation — route it to the
CLI dispatcher, not an MCP tool.** The dispatcher (`cli/buddy.ts`) mirrors each
MCP tool exactly: same state writes, same output strings, same achievements. It
runs as plain bun with no model round-trip. Run from the plugin directory and
output its result verbatim (CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES below still apply):

```bash
bun run cli/buddy.ts <command> [args]
```

Argument mapping (pass args positionally after the command):

| `pick`                   | Tell user to run `! bun run pick` (interactive TUI) |
| `uninstall`              | Run the uninstall sequence (see **Uninstall Orchestration** below) |

Only two things still use the model, and neither is a typed command:
- **Name mention** — if the user says the buddy's name in normal conversation,
  call `buddy_react` (reason `turn`) and display it verbatim. This reads the
  conversation, so it stays an MCP tool.
- **Proactive suggestions** — `buddy_suggest` on a teachable moment, and the
  end-of-turn `<!-- buddy: -->` comment. These read your code/turn.

If the MCP server is unavailable (see fallback above) the dispatcher still works
— it does not depend on the MCP server, only on `bun`.

## CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES

The MCP tools return pre-formatted ASCII art with ANSI colors, box-drawing characters, stat bars, and species art. This is the companion's visual identity.

**You MUST output the tool result text EXACTLY as returned — character for character, line for line.** Do NOT:

- Summarize or paraphrase the ASCII art
- Describe what the companion looks like in prose
- Add commentary before or after the card
- Reformat, rephrase, or interpret the output
- Strip ANSI escape codes

**Just output the raw text content from the tool result. Nothing else.** The ASCII art IS the response.

If the user mentions the buddy's name in normal conversation, call `buddy_react` with reason "turn" and display the result verbatim.

## Uninstall Orchestration

When the user invokes `/buddy uninstall`, run this sequence **in order** — do not skip steps, do not ask for confirmation between steps:

1. Call the MCP tool `buddy_uninstall`. Display its output verbatim.
2. Run via Bash tool: `claude plugin uninstall claude-buddy@claude-buddy`
3. Run via Bash tool: `claude plugin marketplace remove claude-buddy`
4. Run via Bash tool: `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-buddy`
5. Tell the user: uninstall is complete; companion data is kept at `~/.claude-buddy/`; restart Claude Code to release the plugin.

If any Bash step fails (non-zero exit), report the error but continue with the remaining steps — each step is independent and always-safe to run.

Do not call `buddy_uninstall` for any other command than `/buddy uninstall`. Never call it proactively.
